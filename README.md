## Customization

### Changing the Hero Image

The hero image uses Unsplash's API for a vineyard image. To use a custom image:

2. Find the `.hero` class (around line 170)
3. Replace the URL in `background-image` with your own image path

2. Modify the form submission code in `script.js` around line 30
